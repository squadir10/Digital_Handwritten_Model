I wanted to experiment with Machine Learning by coding my own. In this program, I used TenorFlow with Python as well as MSPaint - to hand draw various digits - and had the model guess what the digit was. It has some inaccuracies but since this is a beginner project, I wanted to get an idea and appreciation for Machine Learning, and making my own.

To get started make sure you have the following extensions and softwares.

- A working IDE (preferably VSCode)
- Python (latest version)

  to download the extensions do this:

  - pip install numpy
  - pip install matplotlib
  - pip install tensorflow
  - pip install opencv-python
